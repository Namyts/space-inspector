# Space inspector

A bad version of spacesniffer, as an electron app.

### To install: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Namyts/space-inspector.git

cd space-inspector

npm install

npm run dev
```

<br/>

### To use:

Enter the root path you want to analyse and press Enter.

It will produce a graphic similar to spacesniffer.

KNOWN ISSUES:
-	The update button needs to be pressed once to get the treemap to show.
-	The update button doesn't work after that.
-	The treemap isn't interactive.
-	The treemap visuals are ugly and need to be configured.
